### GenericSpellChecker
This repo serves as the final project of CS598 from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

## Content
In this repo, you can find a simple design of a generic spell correction framework with sets of predefined datasets, models and evaluation methods. The purpose of this framework is to help researchers and professionals to be more productive in proposing and evaluating their spell correction models. 

The package itself comes with a `setup.py` script, however, it is recomended to use the files directly as these contents are subject to change in future release.
