# Generic Spell Checker
This repo should serve as the final project of Fall 2016 CS598 from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, lectured by [Prof. Chengxiang Zhai][prof].

## Content
In this repo, you can find a simple design of a generic spell correction framework with sets of predefined datasets, models and evaluation methods. The purpose of this framework is to help researchers and professionals to be more productive in proposing and evaluating their spell correction models. 

The package itself comes with a `setup.py` script, however, it is recomended to use the files directly as these contents are subject to change in future release.

## Acknowledgment
The dataset we incorporated into our corpus are from Google Research, released by [Peter Norvig][peter]. Information about the dataset can be found on its [official website][web].
